## Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum, and return its sum.

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

Example 1:

```makefile
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Example 2:

```makefile
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

Example 3:

```makefile
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```
